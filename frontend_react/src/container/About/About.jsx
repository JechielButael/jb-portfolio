                I'm very passionate about exploring full-stack development,
                therefore, for the last year, I've been taking online courses
                and worked on personal projects to challenge myself.

                HTML, CSS, Node.js, frameworks such as Tailwind, Material UI,
                Bootstrap, and various npm libraries.
